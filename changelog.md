# Changes

1. Improved reponsive design by adding additional media queries to address feedback from previous homework. Fixed scaling the project images to eliminate the horizontal scrolling bar/needing to zoom. 

2. Styled the 404 page to look more customized and match the color theme of my main portfolio site. Added a special nav bar to the page that directs to sections of the main page. Also added typewriter animation. 

3. Added a gap between the project cards when the media query causes the grid to display all elements in 1 column.

4. Added a button on each project card that will create a mini popup page that provides more details about the project. Also added styling for the button.

** 3rd Party JavaScript ** 
Added 3rd party JavaScript for Google Analytics

Reasoning: Out of the options, I chose to use Google Analytics for my portfolio website. The code is located within a script tag within the head element. For a portfolio, in my opinion, I don't think it matchess my style to have my instragam posts or twitter stream feeding into my page. So the 3rd party JS should be something that is beneficial to me and hidden. Therefore, I chose google analytics, and I can use it to gain insight on the number of visitors + use the other data that it can collect about my portfolio website.
